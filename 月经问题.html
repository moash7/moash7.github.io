    <h2>月经贫困 Period Poverty</h2>

    <h3>什么是月经贫困？What is period poverty?</h3>
    <p lang="zh">月经贫困是指低收入人群买不起或无法获得所需经期产品。平均算来，每次月经约持续5天，每月购买卫生棉条和护垫的成本约为8英镑，部分女性很难负担起这笔费用。</p>
    <p lang="zh">社会企止Hey Girls的乔吉·尼科尔森（Georgie Nicholson）在BBC电台节目《早安苏格兰》表示，经期用品应像公共厕所中的卷纸那样获取轻易。尼科尔森表示，“有一种非常简单的方式来描述月经贫困——当你身处超市，你必须左右权衡，是买一袋意大利面还是用这个钱买一盒卫生棉条，就这么基本。我们听说，很多母亲不使用月经保护用品的原因只是给孩子省口饭，她们会将报纸塞进袜子或用面包充当卫生巾......因为这些都更便宜。”</p>
    <p lang="en">Period poverty is when those on low incomes can't afford, or access, suitable period products.With average periods lasting about five days, it can cost up to￡8 a month for tampons and pads, and some women struggle to afford the cost.</p>
    <p lang="en">Georgie Nicholson, of social enterprise Hey Girls, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland, period products should be as accessible as toilet roll in public bathrooms.
        Ms Nicolson said: “There's a very simple way to describe period poverty: you go to the supermarket and you have to actually choose whether you can buy a bag of pasta or a
        box of tampons. It's that basic.We hear of a lot of mothers going without their period protection just so they can feed their children and using things such as newspaper stuffed into socks or bread...because they're cheaper than period products.”</p>
    <h3>这一问题有多严重？How big a problem is it?</h3>
    <p lang="zh">2018年，苏格兰青年（Young Scot）在对2000多人调查后发现，约四分之一的苏格兰受访学生（包括大、中、小学在内）难以获得经期产品。这一年，苏格兰政府创造了历史，成为世界上首个向学生群体免费提供经期用品的地区。</p>
    <p lang="zh">自该计划启动以来，另一项同样来自苏格兰青年的调查发现，三分之二受访者表示，在过去一-年中，她们在各自学校获得了免费经期用品。在这些免费获得经期用品的学生中，84%表示计划对她们产生了积极影响。</p>
    <p lang="zh">研究人员表示，除经贫困外，月经羞耻也是伴随年轻女孩的-一大困扰，大多数女性在购买经期用品时会感到尴尬。</p>
    <p lang="en">In 2018, a survey of more than 2,000 people by Young Scot found that about one in four respondents at school, college or university in Scotland had struggled to access period products. That year, the Scottish government made history by becoming the first in the world to make period products free to students.</p>
    <p lang="en">Since it launched the scheme, another Young Scot survey found that two-thirds of respondents had received free period products from their school, college or university in the past year. Of those who accessed the free products, 84% said the scheme had a positive impact on them.</p>
    <p lang="en">As well as period poverty, researchers say period stigma is also an issue for young girls, with the majority feeling embarrassed when buying menstruation products.</p>

    <h2>月经羞耻 Period Stigma</h2>
    <img src="images/shame.jpg" alt="月经羞耻">
    <h3>为什么会有月经羞辱？Why is there period stigma?</h3>
    <p lang="zh">从心理学的理论视角看，对月经的消极态度较少源自于先天的恐惧和抗拒，更多源自于社会文化的塑造。如果我们把从小到大接受到的有关月经羞耻的信息放一边，理解月经的本质是生育能力、生命力，就没有任何值得羞耻的点。需要关注的是：人们歌颂母亲的伟大，赞叹生命的不易，却无法正常看待女性生育器官的正常周期变化。</p>
    <p lang="en">From the perspective of psychological theory, the negative attitude towards menstruation is less from innate fear and resistance, and more from social and cultural shaping. If we put aside the messages about menstrual shame that we have received since childhood and understand that the essence of menstruation is fertility, vitality, there is nothing to be ashamed of. What to watch for: People praise the greatness of the mother, praise the difficulty of life, but can not look at the normal cycle of female reproductive organs.</p>
    <p lang="zh">女性月经被视为不洁，月经期的女性遭遇的诸多禁忌，不能进寺院，不能参加敬香仪式，不能参加动土仪式，不能坐在摄影组的工具箱上，不能参加葬礼等等，事实上都是男权社会贬低女性和控制女性的手段。在中国传统文化中，对于“下半身”的禁忌非常普遍，月经因为跟性器官直接相关，更是男女都羞于提起。所以，月经羞耻是有着长远历史文化背景的普遍社会心理。在古代西方社会，月经禁忌也普遍存在。即使在当今西方社会，也仍然存在对女性月经的歧视。媒体不是对月经保持禁默，就是把来月经的女性塑造成情绪不稳定、冲动、攻击性强的形象。</p>
    <p lang="en">Women's menstruation is regarded as unclean, and many taboos encountered by women during menstruation, such as not entering the temple, not participating in the incense ceremony, not participating in the ground-breaking ceremony, not sitting on the toolbox of the photo crew, not attending the funeral, etc., are in fact the means of degrading women and controlling women in the patriarchal society. In traditional Chinese culture, the taboo for the "lower body" is very common, because menstruation is directly related to the sexual organs, but also men and women are ashamed to mention. Therefore, menstrual shame is a common social psychology with a long historical and cultural background. In ancient Western society, menstruation taboo also existed widely.
        Even in today's Western society, there is still discrimination against women's menstruation. The media either maintains a silence on menstruation or portrays menstruating women as emotionally unstable, impulsive, and aggressive.</p>
    <p lang="zh">科学理性的性教育严重不足，性教育歧视，男权文化和传统文化的束缚，导致女性性别矮化的现象持续存在。性教育歧视包括：对女性的性教育中仍暗藏着“月经是肮脏的”，“月经话题是不适合在公众场合讨论”等传统腐朽的理念；对男性的性教育中，有关女性月经的知识只是蜻蜓点水，男生若非主动关注，拥有的女性月经知识则更少得可怜。据统计，青春期女生拥有的月经知识仅有30%来自学校教育，剩下的绝大部分来源于周遭的女性，这些女性对待月经的态度决定了女生对月经的认知。而很多奶奶辈和妈妈辈的女性，还处于视月经羞耻为正常的认知。</p>
    <p lang="en">Scientific and rational sex education is seriously insufficient, sex education discrimination, male culture and traditional culture bondage, resulting in the phenomenon of female gender dwarfization continues to exist. Sex education discrimination includes: the sex education for women is still hidden in the "menstruation is dirty", "menstruation topic is not suitable for public discussion" and other traditional rotten ideas; In male sex education, the knowledge about female menstruation is only a little bit of water, and boys have even less knowledge about female menstruation if they do not take the initiative to pay attention to it. According to statistics, only 30% of adolescent girls' menstrual knowledge comes from school education, and most of the rest comes from the women around them, and the attitude of these women toward menstruation determines the girls' cognition of menstruation. And many grandmothers and mothers are still in the perception of menstrual shame as normal.</p>
    <p lang="zh">当年轻女孩在一个经常因月经感到羞耻的世界中长大，她将习惯于将这种羞耻感传递给她的下一代或当前的圈子。消除月经羞耻，是一个常常被忽视，却对世界上一半人口的日常生活和对社会进步至关重要的问题。而解决问题的第一步，是要引起人们对它的关注。</p>
    <p lang="en">When a young girl grows up in a world where she often feels shame about menstruation, she will be used to passing this shame on to her next generation or current circle.Eliminating menstrual shame is an often overlooked issue that is vital to the daily lives of half the world's population and to social progress. The first step in solving a problem is to draw attention to it.</p>

    <h3>如何停止月经羞辱？How to stop period shaming?</h3>
    <h4>①公开讨论你的例假 Openly Discuss Your Period</h4>
    <p lang="zh">消除与月经相关的社会耻辱的最快方法之一是就月经进行公开和坦诚的对话。我们可以通过打开关于我们的身体、我们在例假期间的感受以及我们经历的障碍的谈话，在来例假的人之间产生一种团结感。你可能认为你在月经期间的经历对你来说是独一无二的，但如果你敞开心扉与朋友、家人和医生讨论它，你可能会发现你并不孤单。</p>
    <p lang="en">One of the quickest ways to remove the societal stigma associated with menstruation is to have open and honest conversations about it. We can generate a sense of solidarity among people with periods by opening up a discourse about our bodies, how we feel during our periods, and the obstacles we experience. You may believe that what you experience during your period is unique to you, but if you open yourself up to discussing it with friends, family, and your doctor, you'll likely discover that you're not alone.</p>
    <h4>②教育自己更多关于月经的信息 Educate Yourself More About Menstruation</h4>
    <p lang="zh">了解更多关于整个经期过程是结束月经羞辱的最有效方法之一。了解经前综合征的体征和症状，月经的不同阶段，以及整个经期中变化的荷尔蒙。如果你掌握了事实，教育那些希望怀疑你的人会容易得多。</p>
    <p lang="en">Learning more about the full period process is one of the most effective methods to end period shaming. Learn about the signs and symptoms of PMS, the different phases of menstruation, and the hormones that change throughout your cycle. It will be a lot easier to educate people who wish to cast doubt on you if you are armed with facts.</p>
    <h4>③不要依赖委婉的短语来让你度过经期 Don‘t Rely On Euphemisms To Get You Through Your Period</h4>
    <p lang="zh">研究表明，月经在全世界有5000多个委婉说法。虽然有些名字很有趣，但它也提醒人们，月经仍然被污名化。我们通过称它为例假或月经来消除一些秘密。你不应该为例假感到羞耻，采用可爱的昵称只是证实了月经是不应该被讨论的。</p>
    <p lang="en">Menstruation has over 5,000 euphemisms over the world, according to studies. While some names are amusing, they also serve as subliminal reminders that periods are still stigmatized. We remove some of the secrets by calling it what it is - a period or menstruation. You shouldn't be ashamed of having a period, and adopting cutesy nicknames merely confirms what we've been taught - that periods aren't to be discussed.</p>
